  Python will be used to model football statistics, or really whatever open data set I can find. The main goal will be to create an accessable machine learning platform for
  contractors and others who wish to manage their own data. Residual plots will lead users through a tree to normalize data and refine model. Seems reasonable enough for now...
  
  The Unreal Engine seems like a good platform for a utility engineering software platform. Once conduits, pipes, utility poles, conductors and accessories have been made into
  blocks physics can be added along with warning messages for overloaded areas. Solutions are usually simple in nature, things need to be bigger. These will also be included in
  a final build.
  
  Much of today's software deliberately isolates the user from their data. This leads to simple linear fits that usually do quite well. However, I believe a better experience can 
  be implemented.
  
  Mind you these are thoughts that haven't been researched or verified, solutions may already exist. I heard a quote recently that struck home: "The first step is to begin".
  
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
